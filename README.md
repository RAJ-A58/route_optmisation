# VRP using OR-Tools + Machine Learning

This repository documents my 30-day journey to solve
Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) using:

- Google OR-Tools
- Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

Daily progress is committed to GitHub.

## Project Goals
- Solve VRP, CVRP, VRPTW using OR-Tools
- Use ML to predict demand and travel time
- Use RL to learn routing heuristics
- Build an integrated ML + OR system
