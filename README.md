# VRP using OR-Tools + Machine Learning

This repository documents my 30-day journey to solve
Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) using:

- Google OR-Tools
- Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

Daily progress is committed to GitHub.

## Project Goals
- Solve VRP, CVRP, VRPTW using OR-Tools
- Use ML to predict demand and travel time
- Use RL to learn routing heuristics
- Build an integrated ML + OR system

Time window constraints were not included in the initial model due to unavailability of reliable MPP operating hour data. The system design allows easy integration of time windows in future iterations.”
